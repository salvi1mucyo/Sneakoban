# Sneakoban

Sneakoban is a fun twist on the classic puzzle game **Sokoban**. Instead of controlling a warehouse worker, you guide a little python 🐍 around a grid, pushing computers 💻 onto target zones 🚩 while navigating around walls 🧱.

This project was built as part of a lab assignment and includes both the game engine and a puzzle-solving program.

## Game Objective

Move the snake around a virtual world, pushing computers onto all the target flags. A level is complete when every target is covered by a computer.

## 🚀 How to Run

To play the game in your browser:

1. Start the server from your terminal:

```bash
python3 server.py
```
Then visit http://localhost:6101 to play the game.
